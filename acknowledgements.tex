Foremost thanks must go to to my supervisors, Lesley Gray and Scott Osprey. Your generosity, technical advice and personal guidance over the past four years has been unrivalled. Lesley - your belief in my ability and understanding of some of my struggles has had more of a positive effect on my life than you probably know. Scott - your laughter, energy and enthusiasm for research is truly infectious. I can safely say I wouldn't have made it anywhere near this point had it not been for the two of you, thank you both.

Thanks also goes to those at AOPP and beyond, especially other members of the Stratosphere and Climate group, for engaging discussions that shaped the research in this thesis - Matt Brown, Jorge Garcia-Franco, Josh Dorrington, Helena Cotterill, Beatriz Monge-Sanz, Stergios Misos, Matt Patterson, Tim Woolings, Blanca Ayarzag√ºena as well as many others. I am also grateful for the NERC DTP in environmental research for funding my project.

Thanks must also go...

to my mum and dad, my grandparents, Harri and Georgia for your unwavering support and belief (and bringing Cassie to visit).

to Ella, Louis and Hamish for being fantastic housemates at 47 Oatlands Road and for your companionship through the highs and lows of a PhD.

to Cameron, Josh and Ben for the fantastic years studying at the University of Edinburgh, for giving me the confidence to continue in physics and for always providing an outlet to vent my frustrations with the subject.

%to Julia for your support and incredible kindness as well as your ability to tolerate me bemoaning the state of my research.

to Hertford college CC and RFC for four fantastic seasons and to OPCC for providing a weekly lifeline through which I could temporarily forget the mental stress of my PhD and focus on the mental stress of having to bat every Saturday. 
 %(and a Cuppers win).
