Foremost thanks must go to to my supervisors, Lesley Gray and Scott Osprey. Your generosity, technical advice and personal guidance over the past 4 years has been unrivalled. Lesley - your belief in my ability and understanding has had more of a positive affect on my life than you probably know. Scott - your laughter, energy and enthusiasm for research is truly infectious. I can safely say I wouldn't have made it anywhere near this point had it not been for the two of you. I couldn't have asked for two better mentors, thank you both.

Thanks must also go to those at AOPP especially other members of the Stratosphere and Climate group (later Climate Dynamics) for engaging discussions that shaped the research in this thesis - Matt Brown, Helena Cotterill, Beatriz Monge-Sanz, Stergios Misos, Matt Patterson, Tim Woolings as well as many others. 

To Josh and Jorge - thank you for unnecessarily long coffee breaks and putting the world to right during them.

To my Mum and Dad, Harri and Georgia. For unwavering support and belief (and bringing Cassie to visit).

To Ella, Louis and Hamish. For being fantastic housemates at 47 Oatlands Road and for your companionship through the high and low points of a PhD.

To Cameron, Josh and Ben. For making the years studying physics at Edinburgh some of the best I've had. For allowing me to continue in physics and always giving me the confidence to keep going. You're all wonderful people who probably don't realise how much you've helped.
