Foremost thanks must go to to my supervisors, Lesley Gray and Scott Osprey. Your generosity, technical advice and personal guidance over the past 4 years has been unrivalled. Lesley - your belief in my ability and understanding has had more of a positive effect on my life than you probably know. Scott - your laughter, energy and enthusiasm for research is truly infectious. I can safely say I wouldn't have made it anywhere near this point had it not been for the two of you. I couldn't have asked for two better mentors, thank you both.

Thanks must also go to those at AOPP, especially other members of the Stratosphere and Climate group (later Climate Dynamics), for engaging discussions that shaped the research in this thesis - Matt Brown, Helena Cotterill, Beatriz Monge-Sanz, Stergios Misos, Matt Patterson, Tim Woolings as well as many others. 

To Josh and Jorge for the camaraderie and mutual support.

To Blanca Ayarzag√ºena for hosting me as a visiting student at UCM and for your guidance, kindness and expertise in the field. 

To my Mum and Dad, Harri and Georgia for your unwavering support and belief (and bringing Cassie to visit).

To Ella, Louis and Hamish for being fantastic housemates at 47 Oatlands Road and for your companionship through the highs and lows of a PhD.

To Cameron, Josh and Ben for the fantastic years studying at the University of Edinburgh, for giving me the confidence to continue in physics and always keep going. You're wonderful people who probably don't realise how much you've helped.

to OPCC for providing a lifeline through which I could temporarily forget the mental anguish of my PhD and focus on the mental anguish of having to go out to bat every Saturday. 

To Hertford college CC and RFC for four amazing seasons with some wonderful people. %(and a Cuppers win).
