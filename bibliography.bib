The irregular oscillation appears to be driven by density anomalies in the sinking region of the thermohaline circulation (approximately 52\textdegree N to 72\textdegree N) combined with much smaller density anomalies of opposite sign in the broad, rising region. The spatial pattern of see surface temperature anomalies associated with this irregular oscillation bears an encouraging resemblance to a pattern of observed interdecadal variability in the North Atlantic. The anomalies of sea surface temperature induce model surface air temperature anomalies over the northern North Atlantic, Arctic, and northwestern Europe.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events can exhibit long-lasting surface impacts that promise improvements in medium-range to seasonal predictability. Their surface impact is dominated by the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Hence, the question arises if stratospheric variability, and in particular the frequency of SSW events, can in turn be estimated from surface NAO conditions. This is especially relevant for the period before frequent upper air observations became available, while daily surface observations of the NAO date back to 1850. The surface impact is here quantified by NAO characteristics that are commonly observed after SSW events: a switch from a positive to a negative NAO and an extended persistence of the negative NAO, termed NAO events. Two thirds of SSW events are found to be followed by either a persistence or switch NAO event, and a quarter of SSW events are followed by both. On the other hand, less than 25\% of winter surface NAO events are preceded by a SSW event. Based on these findings, an index purely based on surface NAO observations is derived that estimates SSW frequency for the satellite era and extends it back to 1850, indicating that decadal stratospheric variability was present for the entire time series, with no significant trend. The minimum in SSW frequency in the 1990s is found to be coincident with the longest absence of NAO events since 1850, indicating that the early 1990s may constitute the longest absence of SSW events for the 150-year record.},

When the atmosphere is compressible, the linear response of the vortex is found to have two distinct components. The first is a spectrum of upward-propagating waves that are excited by forcing with temporal frequencies within a fixed ``Charney\textendash Drazin'' range that depends on the angular velocity at the vortex edge and the vortex Burger number. The second component of the response is a barotropic mode, which is excited by forcing with a fixed temporal frequency outside the Charney\textendash Drazin range. The relative magnitude of the two responses, in terms of total angular pseudomomentum, depends on the ratio of the horizontal scale of the forcing to the Rossby radius. Under typical stratospheric conditions the barotropic response is found to dominate. Nonlinear simulations confirm that the linear results remain relevant to understanding the response in cases when strongly nonlinear Rossby wave breaking ensues. It is shown that a sudden warming, or rapid increase in vortex angular pseudomomentum, can be generated at much lower forcing amplitudes when the barotropic mode is resonantly excited compared to when the upward-propagating waves are excited. A numerical simulation of a ``barotropic sudden warming'' due to excitation of the barotropic mode by a relatively weak topographic forcing is described.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {AbstractThe fundamental dynamics of ``vortex splitting'' stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs), which are known to be predominantly barotropic in nature, are reexamined using an idealized single-layer f-plane model of the polar vortex. The aim is to elucidate the conditions under which a stationary topographic forcing causes the model vortex to split, and to express the splitting condition as a function of the model parameters determining the topography and circulation.For a specified topographic forcing profile the model behavior is governed by two nondimensional parameters: the topographic forcing height M and a surf-zone potential vorticity parameter {$\Omega$}. For relatively low M, vortex splits similar to observed SSWs occur only for a narrow range of {$\Omega$} values. Further, a bifurcation in parameter space is observed: a small change in {$\Omega$} (or M) beyond a critical value can lead to an abrupt transition between a state with low-amplitude vortex Rossby waves and a sudden vortex split. The model behavior can be fully u...}

Internal stratospheric variability arises from the competing actions of radiative forcing, which under perpetual winter conditions strengthens the polar vortex, and planetary wave breaking, which weakens it. The results from a stratosphere-only model demonstrate that strong internal stratospheric variability, consisting of repeated sudden warming-type events, exists over a wide range of realistic radiative and wave forcing conditions, and is largely independent of other physical and numerical parameters. In particular, the coherent form of the variability persists as the number of degrees of freedom is increased, and is therefore not an artifact of severe model truncation. Various diagnostics, including three-dimensional representations of the potential vorticity, illustrate that the variability is determined by the vertical structure of the vortex and the extent to which upward wave propagation is favored or inhibited. In this paper, the variability arising from purely internal stratosphere dynamics is isolated by specifying thermal and wave forcings that are completely time independent. In a second paper, the authors investigate the relative importance of internal and external variability by considering time-dependent wave forcing as a simple representation of tropospheric variability.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},
