  abstract = {In January 2009 and 2010, two major stratospheric warmings (MSWs) took place in the boreal polar stratosphere. Both MSWs were preceded by nearly the strongest injection of tropospheric wave activity on record since 1958 and their central date was almost coincident. However, the typical external factors that influence the occurrence of MSWs (the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, sunspot cycle, or El Ni\~no) were dissimilar in the two midwinters: favorable in 2010 but unfavorable in 2009. In this study, the driving mechanisms of these two different MSWs were investigated focusing on the amplification of upward wave activity injection into the stratosphere before the MSW onset. By decomposing the total wave flux injection into contributions from the climatological planetary waves and from deviations from the latter we found clear differences in this amplification between both MSWs. The pre-MSW period in 2009 was characterized by a peak in the 100 hPa eddy heat flux with a predominance of wave number 2 activity. This was due to strong anomalies associated with Rossby wave packets originating from a deep ridge over the eastern Pacific. In contrast, the amplification of the upward wave propagation prior to the 2010 MSW was equally due to Rossby wave packets and to the interaction between the latter and the climatological waves. This amplification enhanced wave number 1 stationary waves in January 2010, which seemed at least partially due to the 2009/2010 El Ni\~no event. Our results show the relevance of the internal tropospheric variability in generating MSWs, particularly when the external factors do not play any role.},

  abstract = {Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events can exhibit long-lasting surface impacts that promise improvements in medium-range to seasonal predictability. Their surface impact is dominated by the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Hence, the question arises if stratospheric variability, and in particular the frequency of SSW events, can in turn be estimated from surface NAO conditions. This is especially relevant for the period before frequent upper air observations became available, while daily surface observations of the NAO date back to 1850. The surface impact is here quantified by NAO characteristics that are commonly observed after SSW events: a switch from a positive to a negative NAO and an extended persistence of the negative NAO, termed NAO events. Two thirds of SSW events are found to be followed by either a persistence or switch NAO event, and a quarter of SSW events are followed by both. On the other hand, less than 25\% of winter surface NAO events are preceded by a SSW event. Based on these findings, an index purely based on surface NAO observations is derived that estimates SSW frequency for the satellite era and extends it back to 1850, indicating that decadal stratospheric variability was present for the entire time series, with no significant trend. The minimum in SSW frequency in the 1990s is found to be coincident with the longest absence of NAO events since 1850, indicating that the early 1990s may constitute the longest absence of SSW events for the 150-year record.},

When the atmosphere is compressible, the linear response of the vortex is found to have two distinct components. The first is a spectrum of upward-propagating waves that are excited by forcing with temporal frequencies within a fixed ``Charney\textendash Drazin'' range that depends on the angular velocity at the vortex edge and the vortex Burger number. The second component of the response is a barotropic mode, which is excited by forcing with a fixed temporal frequency outside the Charney\textendash Drazin range. The relative magnitude of the two responses, in terms of total angular pseudomomentum, depends on the ratio of the horizontal scale of the forcing to the Rossby radius. Under typical stratospheric conditions the barotropic response is found to dominate. Nonlinear simulations confirm that the linear results remain relevant to understanding the response in cases when strongly nonlinear Rossby wave breaking ensues. It is shown that a sudden warming, or rapid increase in vortex angular pseudomomentum, can be generated at much lower forcing amplitudes when the barotropic mode is resonantly excited compared to when the upward-propagating waves are excited. A numerical simulation of a ``barotropic sudden warming'' due to excitation of the barotropic mode by a relatively weak topographic forcing is described.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Motivated by the fact that observed events occur at a fixed orientation to the earth's surface and have a strongly baroclinic vertical structure, vortex Rossby waves are forced by a stationary topographic forcing designed to minimize excursions of the vortex from its initial position. Variations in the background stratospheric ``climate'' are represented by means of an additional flow in solid body rotation.

A forced nonlinear oscillator equation is proposed to describe the nonlinear behavior, and a method for determining the relevant coefficients numerically, using unforced calculations of steadily propagating vortex ``V states,'' is adopted. The nonlinear equation predicts some qualitative details of the variation in the response at finite {$<$}em{$>$}M{$<$}/em{$>$}.

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) in the Arctic winters 2003/04-2009/10. There were 6 major SSWs (major warmings [MWs]) in 6 out of the 7 winters, in which the MWs of 2003/04, 2005/06, and 2008/09 were in January and those of 2006/07, 2007/08, and 2009/10 were in February. Although the winter 2009/10 was relatively cold from mid-December to mid-January, strong wave 1 activity led to a MW in early February, for which the largest momentum flux among the winters was estimated at 60\textdegree{} N/10 hPa, about 450 m2 s-2. The strongest MW, however, was observed in 2008/09 and the weakest in 2006/07. The MW in 2008/09 was triggered by intense wave 2 activity and was a vortex split event. In contrast, strong wave 1 activity led to the MWs of other winters and were vortex displacement events. Large amounts of Eliassen-Palm (EP) and wave 1/2 EP fluxes (about 2-4 \texttimes 105 kg s-2) are estimated shortly before the MWs at 100 hPa averaged over 45-75\textdegree{} N in all winters, suggesting profound tropospheric forcing for the MWs. We observe an increase in the occurrence of MWs (\textasciitilde 1.1 MWs/winter) in recent years (1998/99-2009/10), as there were 13 MWs in the 12 Arctic winters, although the long-term average (1957/58-2009/10) of the frequency stays around its historical value (\textasciitilde 0.7 MWs/winter), consistent with the findings of previous studies. An analysis of the chemical ozone loss in the past 17 Arctic winters (1993/94-2009/10) suggests that the loss is inversely proportional to the intensity and timing of MWs in each winter, where early (December-January) MWs lead to minimal ozone loss. Therefore, this high frequency of MWs in recent Arctic winters has significant implications for stratospheric ozone trends in the northern hemisphere.},

The composite comprises 39 major and minor warming events using 44 years of NCEP\textendash NCAR reanalysis data. The incipient stage of the life cycle is characterized by preconditioning of the stratospheric zonal flow and anomalous, quasi-stationary wavenumber-1 forcing in both the stratosphere and troposphere. As the life cycle intensifies, planetary wave driving gives rise to weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex and downward propagation of the attendant easterly wind and positive temperature anomalies. When these anomalies reach the tropopause, the life cycle is marked by momentum flux and mean meridional circulation anomalies at tropospheric levels that are consistent with the negative phase of the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The anomalous momentum fluxes are largest over the Atlantic half of the hemisphere and are associated primarily with waves of wavenumber 3 and higher.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The Arctic polar vortex split during the 2009 SSW, whereas the 2006 SSW was a vortex displacement event. Winds reversed to easterly more rapidly and reverted to westerly more slowly in 2009 than in 2006. More mixing of trace gases out of the vortex during the decay of the vortex fragments, and less before the fulfillment of major SSW criteria, was seen in 2009 than in 2006; persistent well-defined fragments of vortex and anticyclone air were more prevalent in 2009. The 2009 SSW had a more profound impact on the lower stratosphere than any previously observed SSW, with no significant recovery of the vortex in that region. The stratopause breakdown and subsequent reformation at very high altitude, accompanied by enhanced descent into a rapidly strengthening upper stratospheric vortex, were similar in 2009 and 2006. Many differences between 2006 and 2009 appear to be related to the different character of the SSWs in the two years.},

If global-scale disturbances are generated in the troposphere, they propagate upward into the stratosphere, where the waves act to decelerate the polar night jet through the induction of a meridional circulation. Thus, the distortion and the break-down of the polar vortex occur. If the disturbance is intense and persists, the westerly jet may eventually disappear and an easterly wind may replace it. Then ``critical layer interaction'' takes place. Further intensification of the easterly wind and rapid warming of the polar air are expected to occur as well as weakening of the disturbance. The model is verified by numerical integrations of the adiabatic-geostrophic potential vorticity equation.

The aim is to elucidate the conditions under which a stationary topographic forcing causes the model vortex to split, and to express the splitting condition as a function of the model parameters determining the topography and circulation.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}For a specified topographic forcing profile the model behavior is governed by two nondimensional parameters: the topographic forcing height {$<$}em{$>$}M{$<$}/em{$>$} and a surf-zone potential vorticity parameter {$\Omega$}. For relatively low {$<$}em{$>$}M{$<$}/em{$>$}, vortex splits similar to observed SSWs occur only for a narrow range of {$\Omega$} values. Further, a bifurcation in parameter space is observed: a small change in {$\Omega$} (or {$<$}em{$>$}M{$<$}/em{$>$}) beyond a critical value can lead to an abrupt transition between a state with low-amplitude vortex Rossby waves and a sudden vortex split. The model behavior can be fully understood using two nonlinear analytical reductions: the Kida model of elliptical vortex motion in a uniform strain flow and a forced nonlinear oscillator equation. The abrupt transition in behavior is a feature of both reductions and corresponds to the onset of a nonlinear (self-tuning) resonance. The results add an important new aspect to the ``resonant excitation'' theory of SSWs. Under this paradigm, it is not necessary to invoke an anomalous tropospheric planetary wave source, or unusually favorable conditions for upward wave propagation, in order to explain the occurrence of SSWs.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {A diagnostic framework is introduced in which anomalous zonally averaged Rossby wave-activity injection into the stratosphere is decomposed into a contribution solely from zonally confined upward-propagating Rossby wave packets and another from interaction of the wave packets with the climatological planetary waves. To pinpoint the tropospheric sources of the wave packets, a particular form of wave-activity flux is evaluated for the associated circulation anomalies. The framework is applied to reanalysis data for the period prior to a stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event in January 2006, which was associated with two successive events of above-normal wave-activity injection from the troposphere. In the earlier event, a pair of wave packets that emanated from tropospheric anomalies over the North Pacific and over Europe enhanced the upward wave-activity injection, which was augmented further by their interaction with the climatological planetary wave. In contrast, in the later period a wave packet that emanated from an anticyclonic anomaly over the North Atlantic is found to be the primary contributor to the enhanced planetary wave-activity injection, while its interaction with the climatological planetary wave contributed negatively. The predominant importance of the sole contribution from a single wave packet is also found in a major SSW event observed over Antarctica in September 2002. These results indicate that the diagnostic framework presented in this study is a useful tool for understanding the interaction between anomalies associated with zonally confined wave packets and climatological-mean planetary waves in the study of stratosphere\textendash troposphere dynamical coupling.

Internal stratospheric variability arises from the competing actions of radiative forcing, which under perpetual winter conditions strengthens the polar vortex, and planetary wave breaking, which weakens it. The results from a stratosphere-only model demonstrate that strong internal stratospheric variability, consisting of repeated sudden warming-type events, exists over a wide range of realistic radiative and wave forcing conditions, and is largely independent of other physical and numerical parameters. In particular, the coherent form of the variability persists as the number of degrees of freedom is increased, and is therefore not an artifact of severe model truncation. Various diagnostics, including three-dimensional representations of the potential vorticity, illustrate that the variability is determined by the vertical structure of the vortex and the extent to which upward wave propagation is favored or inhibited. In this paper, the variability arising from purely internal stratosphere dynamics is isolated by specifying thermal and wave forcings that are completely time independent. In a second paper, the authors investigate the relative importance of internal and external variability by considering time-dependent wave forcing as a simple representation of tropospheric variability.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},
